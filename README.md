This was a project challenge for a job application. I have to make a WordsPress Guttenberg Block that connects to an external API.

Technologies involved: WordPress, PHP, JavaScript, React

If you want to know about what happened with the job: The project was accepted but I did not pass the onsite round of interviews.
